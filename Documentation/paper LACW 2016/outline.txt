Introduction

Modeling

	- System of interest
	- Hypotheses
	- Modeling of the mechanical subsystem
		- Newton's law
		- Viscous friction
		- Coulomb friction
	- Modeling of the electrical subsystem
		- Kirchoff's laws x citation to S. Baldursson?*
			- observation about the mutual inductance being disregarded
		- Back-emfs in each phase
		- Torque in each phase, total torque

Implementation

	- BLDC implementation
		- Perhaps short text explaining that most parts of the equations can be immediately implemented, with exceptions being discussed in the following
		- how the back-emfs were implemented
			- lookup table, default or user-specified
		- how the coulomb friction was implemented
			- zero-crossing information
	- Block commutation
		- short explanation (maybe picture)
		- hall sensors signals generation (using LUT)
		- decoder
	- Encoder
		- quadrature
		- using hall sensors
	- M, T and M/T**

Validation

	- Description of the real motor being used, including all parameters and short expl. on how they were calculated
	- Choice of input
	- Output from simulation x Real measurements
